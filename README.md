# Slingshot Game

Yet another physics related thing(obviously in one HTML file). This one is more pointless, but still is able to grab your attention for 10 seconds.

Some may also ask: **Why not make this game in a game engine like godot?** The answer is that hate using godot, and most game engines cannot pack all of the assets inside of one HTML file.
